circulation
===========
optimal range
	20-30
affects
	turbidity
		lowers if >30
		rises if <20
	oxygen
		rises if >30
		lowers if <20
depends
	?

dead fish
=========
optimal range
	0
affects
	ec
		rises if >0
	turbidity
		rises if >0
	oxygen
		rises if >0
depends
	ph
		must be 6.8-8.0
			more dead fish if outside of range
	temp
		must be 20-45c
			more dead fish if outside of range
	ec (ec = nutrients)
		1 unit per fish
			~20 fish in tank initially

ec (stuff in water, same as nutrients)
=======================
optimal range
	1 * numFish
affects
	dead fish
	turbidity
		more ec = more turbidity
depends
	dead fish

temp
====
optimal range
	20-45c
affects
	dead fish
depends
	?

turbidity
=========
affects
	ec
depends
	ec
	dead fish
	circulation

water level
===========
affects
	dead fish
		fish die if level = 0
depends
	?

ph
==
optimal range
	6.8-8.0
affects
	dead fish
		more dead fish if outside range
depends
	?

oxygen
======
optimal range
	1*numFish
affects
	dead fish
depends
	circulation


PROBLEM
	- no way to control circulation and oxygen level
