All systems: Address general quality problems

This includes:
Incorrect Eclipse project names

DONE - Nathan - Incorrect release numbering

Poorly written javadocs.

Bad package-level design

Lack of JUnit tests or errors during testing.

Low coverage.

Better data validity checking.  

Better error handling, better logging when invalid data values encountered.

Support testing both with and without other components available.

Clean up console logging.

Improve XML parsing (try XPath).

House Simulator:  Required enhancements
Support version 2.0 of the HTTP API.
Provide more realistic simulations of house systems: define a "model" of how each house system's values are simulated and document this model. The model should not be "pick a random number", but should reflect realistic values for each house system's state and how they might change over the course of a day. 
Upon startup, write out a file called initial-data.xml into the ~/.iHale directory (the same directory where the device-urls.properties file is written).  The initial-data.xml file will contain state data that can be read in by the Backend system to initialize its repository. You will need to work with the Backend group to define the structure of this file.  It makes sense to use the same XML structures specified in the HTTP API whenever possible.
